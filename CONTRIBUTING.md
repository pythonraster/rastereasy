3.  **Make your changes**: Implement your changes in this branch. Feel free to add tests if relevant.

4.  **Submit a Pull Request**: Once your changes are complete, open a Pull Request from your branch to the `main` branch of the `rastereasy` project. Clearly describe the changes you've made in the PR description.
